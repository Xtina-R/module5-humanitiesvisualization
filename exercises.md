## Sprucing up a pdf in Inkscape
Graphic images come in two flavours. There are _raster_ images and then there are _vector_ images. Raster images are composed of pixels, such that if you zoom into them, they become a pointilist blur (if you remember _Ferris Beuller's Day Off_, there's a scene where Cameron stares and stares at a painting, falling into its individual points of colour...). Vector images on the other hand are described by mathematical functions, of lines and arcs and areas. No matter how deep you delve into these kinds of images, the image is always sharp - because the zoom is just another function of the mathematics describing the image.

Rasters: blocks of colours
Vectors: descriptions of points and arcs

Some of the tools that we used in Module 4 give visual output as raster images, others as vectors. Sometimes, we would like to tweak these outputs to make them more visually appealling, or clearer, or more useful. A program like MS Paint is only useful for dealing with raster images (and then, only in certain kinds of cases). We need a program that can deal with both, and also, lets us edit the image by treating each edit we do as a mostly-transparent layer on top of the image. That way, we can add, rearrange, hide or reveal, our edits to create a composite image. A free program that is immensely useful in this regard is [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/). Inkscape is also quite useful in that we can open a pdf file in it, break the visual elements of the pdf into individual layers, and then rearrange/touch up/fix them up to make them more esthetically appealing.

In this exercise, you will take one of the outputs from Module 4 and make it more visually appealing.
